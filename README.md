## Objective
To provide an easy-to-use dashboard that helps users analyze financial data, identify trends, and predict company performance, using data from the SEC EDGAR platform.

## Collaborative Workflow: Roles and Pipelines

### 1. **Data Engineers**
**Role**: Manage the ingestion, transformation, and storage of SEC EDGAR data.
- Data Engineers will use APIs to pull data from SEC EDGAR and transform it using SQL and Python before storing it in databases. They will ensure data is clean and validated for further use by other teams.

### 2. **Data Analysts**
**Role**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and create visualizations.
- Analysts will access data through URLs into Power Query to clean and structure the data. They will perform analysis and create visualizations using Power BI, helping users compare companies across industries.

### 3. **Data Scientists**
**Role**: Develop predictive models to forecast company performance.
- Data Scientists will access the data through APIs, run advanced machine learning models, and deploy predictions that can be integrated into the dashboard, offering insights into future trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings
- **Historical trends**: Revenue, expenses, net income, and EPS over time.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing companies across industries.
- **Outliers**: Detecting companies that deviate significantly from industry norms.

---

## CI/CD Configurations
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD setup for automating testing and deployment.
- **Branching Strategy**:
    - **DEV**: For development and testing.
    - **pre-LIVE**: For pre-production staging.
    - **LIVE**: For production-ready deployments.
