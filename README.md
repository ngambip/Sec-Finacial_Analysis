- Complex and time-consuming process of analyzing financial reports.
- Lack of easy tools for comparing companies across industries.
- Frequent data updates and model enhancements disrupting user experience.

## Solution
A user-friendly dashboard that:
- Integrates financial data from the SEC EDGAR database.
- Displays key metrics such as revenue, expenses, net income, and earnings per share over time.
- Provides comparative analysis tools to benchmark companies against industry peers.
- Includes predictive analytics to forecast future financial performance based on historical trends.
- Automates testing and deployment through CI/CD pipelines.
- Maintains separate environments using feature branches in GitHub for safe updates and releases.

## Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- Investors
- Financial Analysts

**Secondary Users:**
- Market Analysts
- Portfolio Managers
- Corporate Finance Teams

## Use Cases

### 1. Evaluate Company Performance
**User Story:**  
As an investor, I want to analyze the financial performance of individual US companies over past fiscal periods so that I can make informed investment decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
The dashboard should provide a clear analysis and reporting suite that visualizes historical data for selected companies.

### 2. Compare Industry Peers
**User Story:**  
As a financial analyst, I want to compare companies within the same industry to benchmark performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
The dashboard should include a competitor analysis report and tools to perform industry peer comparisons.

### 3. Predict Future Performance
**User Story:**  
As a market analyst, I want to predict future performance based on historical trends.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
The dashboard should include predictive models with a user-friendly interface for forecasting financial performance.

## Technical Requirements

### Data Integration and Storage
- Extract financial data from the SEC EDGAR database.
- Use SQL and Python to transform and clean the data.
- Store the cleaned data in a SQL database.
- Run data quality checks (e.g., row counts, duplicates).
- Create views to expose the correct data for visualization.

### Agile Setup
- **Tasks:**
  - Create GitHub Projects to manage user stories, sprints, features, tasks, and bugs, similar to an Azure DevOps structure.
  - Maintain boards for visual tracking of project progress.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Tasks:**
  - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
  - Create a build workflow to deploy successful builds to the DEV environment.
  - Deploy from DEV to LIVE (main) environment after successful testing and approvals.

### Data Observability
- Use data observability tools such as Monte Carlo or Datadog.
- Assign data engineers to build and monitor observability pipelines.
- Monitor for data drift, schema changes, and data quality issues.

### Dev and Live Environments
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a DEV branch for development.
  - Create a pre-LIVE branch for stable releases.
  - Create a LIVE branch for production-ready code.
  - Use feature branches to isolate individual developer changes, merging into DEV after code review and testing.

### Data Visualization
- Use Power BI to create the dashboard.
- Develop intuitive user interfaces with filters and sorting options for different financial metrics.
- Ensure that the dashboard is regularly updated with the latest data.

### Documentation
All relevant documentation should be included in the README and other appropriate files:
- Data sources
- Dashboard blueprint/mock-ups
- System architecture
- Project directory structure
- Transformation logic
- Data quality checks
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) findings
- CI/CD configurations
- Analysis conclusions
- Source code
- Deployment and maintenance instructions

## Success Criteria
The dashboard should:
- Provide accurate and up-to-date financial metrics for individual companies and industries.
- Have a user-friendly interface for navigating, filtering, and sorting data.
- Include tools for comparing multiple companies within the same industry.
- Feature reliable predictive models with clear outputs and adjustable parameters.
- Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- Ensure continuous improvement with minimal disruptions to the user experience.

## Data Quality Checks
To ensure the quality of the data, the following checks will be implemented:

- Column count checks
- Data type checks
- Duplicate checks
- Consistency checks
- Outlier detection
- Formatting checks
- Character length checks
- Numeric range checks

## Expected Information
The target users (investors, financial analysts, portfolio managers) can expect the following information from the dashboard:
- **Key financial metrics**: Revenue, expenses, net income, earnings per share (EPS), return on equity (ROE), and debt-to-equity ratio.
- **Trends and comparisons**: Insights into financial trends over time and comparison across industry peers.
- **Predictive insights**: Forecasts of future financial performance using historical data and predictive models.
- **Benchmarking tools**: Benchmark companies against industry standards and identify outliers.

- Total revenue (integer/float)
- Total expenses (integer/float)
- Net income (integer/float)
- Earnings per share (EPS) (float)
- Return on equity (ROE) (float)
- Debt-to-equity ratio (float)
- Operating cash flow (integer/float)
- Industry sector (string)
